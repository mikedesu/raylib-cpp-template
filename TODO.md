# TODO

- [ ] re-organize how music and sound effects are handled
- [ ] explore korg gadget for samples we can use
- [x] "properly" handle scene transitions
    - [x] need to be able to close a scene and then re-initialize it later
- [ ] move `draw()` and other type methods into sub-classes of `Scene`
    - [ ] this way we can define `draw()` on a per-scene basis and eliminate some of the hard-coding in `Scene::draw()`
